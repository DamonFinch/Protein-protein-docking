# DeepRank Machinery Version 0.0

These files allows to :

 ..* assemble data from different sources (PDB,PSSM,Scores,....) in a comprehensible data base where each conformation has its own folder. In each folder are stored the conformation, features and targets.

 ..* Map several features to a grid. The type of features as well as the grid parameters can 
 be freely chosen. New features can be mapped without havng to recompute old ones.

 ..* Use a 3d or 2d CNN to predict possible targets (binary class, haddock-score ...) from the data set
